# Tank Application

This is the documentation for the TIA Portal project [tia-tank-application.7z](https://github.com/industrial-edge/miscellaneous/blob/main/tank%20application/tia-tank-application.7z). 
The project simulates a tank and filling process that is used as reference application for different How Tos within industrial edge.

## Introduction

### Overview

This application is used within various use cases to demonstrate the industrial edge functionality and apps. It is based on a STEP 7 TIA project with corresponding HMI. The application simulates the filling process from a tank into bottles. The necessary simulation models for the tank and the bottles are embedded.
The application can be controlled via the HMI screen.
